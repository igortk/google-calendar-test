# Google Calendar E2E Tests (Playwright) üìÖ

This repository contains End-to-End (E2E) tests for Google Calendar's CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, implemented using **Playwright** and **TypeScript**.

The tests follow the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern for maintainability and use Playwright's native features for handling authentication.

***

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the tests locally.

### Prerequisites

You need **Node.js** (version 18 or higher) installed on your system.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igortk/google-calendar-test.git
cd .\google-calendar-test\
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the project dependencies, including Playwright:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Install Browser Binaries
Playwright requires specific browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) to run the tests.
```bash
npx playwright install
```

## üîê Authentication Setup
The project is configured to automatically manage authentication using Playwright's storageState feature:

1. A dedicated setup project is defined in playwright.config.ts.
2. If the authentication file (google-auth.json) does not exist, the setup project will run first, opening a browser for you to log in.
3. Your session will be saved to the file (google-auth.json), and all subsequent tests will reuse this state, skipping the manual login.

‚ÄºÔ∏èIf you don't want to manually provide your credentials for every run, feel free to comment out these configuration sections.
Just remove the entire "setup" project configuration and comment out/delete the dependency on it in your other projects (dependencies: ['setup']).
```
projects: [
    {
      name: "setup",
      ...
    },
    {
      name: "end-to-end",
      ...
      dependencies: ['setup'],
    }
]
```
